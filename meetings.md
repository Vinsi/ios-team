## Meetings

### iOS weekly

This is a weekly meeting which is happening either on Monday or on Tuesday, depending on the day business.
Meeting has some key points action points and discussion points:
* Pick up the tasks and assign to each team member for the upcoming week;
* Discuss and set the final estimations of the tasks for each member;
* Discuss teamy things, proposals and overall ideas for improvements;

There are some actions required to be before the weekly. The all `New Issues` have to be estimated
by each developer in the comments. So at the moment of the weekly, everybody has their own estimation in mind.
Eventually, this is something similar to scrum poker estimation, but not in the same time.

### iOS monthly

This is a meeting to discuss the overall team's achievements and velocity during the past month.
The first meeting is only going to happen so we'll see what we'll discuss and what is going to be in the meeting.
